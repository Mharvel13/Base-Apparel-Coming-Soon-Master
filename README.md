## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

#### THE USE OF CSS POSITIONING

CSS positon was used to move the header logo to the top for viewing on mobile screen sizes

```css
@media screen and (max-width: 900px) {
    header {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        text-align: left;
    }
}
```
